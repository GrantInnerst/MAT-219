In this assignment, I want you to first answer the essential (and yet not so easy) question "What is data science?" Use your experiences in this class, your previous knowledge of the subject if it exists, and what you can find on the internet to define what data science means in general and what data science means to you. Second, I want you to find a cool application of data science and describe it to me. It could be in your field of interest or a non-academic interest.




## Question 1: What is data science?






## Question 2: What is a cool application of data science?

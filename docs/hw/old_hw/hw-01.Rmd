## Assignment

There is an assignment on our GitHub Organization page that is our first homework! Log into RStudio Cloud and create a new project from that Git Repo. Then follow the directions in the assignment, which is the R Markdown file.

## Grading

You will be graded on the correctness of your answers, not your coding style. That will come later! Your grade will be out of 100 points.

## Assignment Description

This is your first Tidy Tuesday data analysis assignment! As I mentioned before, Tidy Tuesday is a collective that releases a dataset each week for people to use to strength their data science skills. That's what we are going to do here!

Right now, the main thing you know how to do is make graphs, so that's what we are going to do here! For this assignment, I want you to explore the dataset released on 2/6/2024 by making at least three different plots. At least one of the plots need to contain two or more different variables. In addition to the plot, you need to write a discussion about why you chose the specific plot type and variables as well as what that plot tells you about the data.



```{r load packages}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library("tidyverse");theme_set(theme_bw())
```


```{r load the dataset}

```

```{r analysis}

```
